# RSA

## Tip

p, q, n, d, e are kept separately\. (e, n) stands for public key while (d, n) stands for private key(or secret key)\. All files should be placed in the folder "file" in the same directory with the \.exe\. If everything is prepared beforehand, DO NOT choose to generate a new key\. 

## Command

```
e3rsa -p ./file/RSA_plain.txt -n ./file/N.txt -e ./file/E.txt -D ./file/D.txt -c ./file/RSA_cipher.txt
```
